## Backend & Data Engineer

I build backend systems and data pipelines.

Most of my work involves designing APIs, moving data between systems, modeling databases, and deploying everything to AWS or Azure. I mainly work with Python and Node.js, with PostgreSQL usually at the center of the system.

I’ve worked on production systems used for analytics, reporting, and internal operations. I’m comfortable owning backend and data workflows end to end, from initial design to deployment and ongoing support.

## What I Work On

- Backend services with Node.js (Express, NestJS) and Django  
- ETL pipelines on AWS and Azure  
- Data ingestion from APIs, CSVs, and third-party systems  
- Transforming and modeling data for reporting and dashboards  
- Database design and query optimization (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL)  
- Background jobs, scheduled workflows, and data processing

## Data Integration

I work on systems where data comes from different sources and needs to be combined into something usable.

That usually involves:

- Connecting to third-party APIs, databases, or flat files  
- Designing clear data models for analytics and reporting  
- Building structured layers for raw, cleaned, and reporting-ready data  
- Writing transformations that make inconsistent data usable  
- Setting up scheduled ingestion and update workflows  
- Making sure pipelines are predictable and easy to debug
