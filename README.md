## Backend & Data Engineer

I work on backend systems and data pipelines.

That usually means building APIs, moving data between systems, designing databases, and deploying things to cloud environments. Most of my work is Python and Node.js, with a lot of PostgreSQL and cloud data tooling in between.

I’ve worked on production systems used for reporting, analytics, and internal tools, and I’m comfortable owning backend and data workflows end to end.

### What I work on
- Node.js and Django backend services  
- ETL pipelines on AWS and Azure  
- Database design and query optimization  
- Data ingestion, cleaning, and transformations  
- Role-based access control and permissions  
- Background jobs and backend workflows
